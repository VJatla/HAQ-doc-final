## Combination classifier
* **Feedback:**
  Multi-class classfier Vs two binary classifier. Which one is better?

* **Response:**
  After discussion the current idea is abandoned in favor of two binary classifers.
  ```
  Reason: In our framework the typing and writing are mutually exclusive. This is because
  we first propose potential typing regions using keyboard detection. This implies that
  there will not be any writing in these regions.
  ```
## Activity maps
* **Feedback:**
  Display only $n$ links in $\Delta T$ seconds. Play with $n$ and $\Delta T$ to determine the combination that works.

* **Response:**
  I am able to achieve responsive activity maps by displaying activities whose
  end times are separated by atleast $\Delta T$ seconds.
